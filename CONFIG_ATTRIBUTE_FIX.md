# Config Attribute Error - Fixed ✅

## Problem Summary
The application was failing with repeated errors:
```
'Config' object has no attribute 'executable'
```

This error was occurring continuously with retry attempts, preventing the Streamlit app from functioning.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the **TransVarAdapter initialization** in two files:

1. **`genomics_automation/pipeline.py` Line 71**: 
   - **Wrong**: `TransVarAdapter(config)` - passing full Config object
   - **Should be**: `TransVarAdapter(config.transvar)` - passing TransVarConfig object

2. **`tests/test_transvar.py` Line 188**:
   - **Wrong**: `TransVarAdapter(self.config)` - passing full Config object  
   - **Should be**: `TransVarAdapter(self.config.transvar)` - passing TransVarConfig object

## Technical Details

### Config Structure:
```python
Config
├── transvar: TransVarConfig
│   ├── executable: str
│   ├── database: DatabaseType
│   ├── ref_version: ReferenceVersion
│   └── ...
├── paths: PathConfig
├── processing: ProcessingConfig
└── ...
```

### TransVarAdapter Expected Interface:
The `TransVarAdapter.__init__(transvar_config)` expects a `TransVarConfig` object, not the full `Config` object.

When the full `Config` was passed, the adapter tried to access `self.config.executable` instead of the correct nested structure.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Pipeline Initialization
**File**: `/workspaces/Impact-Assessment/genomics_automation/pipeline.py`
```python
# Before (WRONG):
self.transvar_adapter = TransVarAdapter(config)

# After (FIXED):
self.transvar_adapter = TransVarAdapter(config.transvar)
```

### 2. Fixed Test Configuration  
**File**: `/workspaces/Impact-Assessment/tests/test_transvar.py`
```python
# Before (WRONG):
self.adapter = TransVarAdapter(self.config)

# After (FIXED):  
self.adapter = TransVarAdapter(self.config.transvar)
```

## Verification
- ✅ Application starts without configuration errors
- ✅ No more attribute access failures
- ✅ Configuration test passes in start.sh
- ✅ Streamlit interface loads successfully
- ✅ All other components (SARJ, TPS, JSON→CSV) remain functional

## Impact
This fix resolves the fundamental configuration issue that was preventing the entire application from starting. The TransVarAdapter now receives the correct configuration object and can access its attributes properly.

## Current Status
**Application fully operational at http://localhost:8501**

The genomics automation pipeline is now ready for complete end-to-end testing with VCF file uploads.
