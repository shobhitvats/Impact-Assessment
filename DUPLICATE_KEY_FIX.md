# Streamlit Duplicate Key Error - Fixed ✅

## Problem Summary
The application was crashing with a `StreamlitDuplicateElementKey` error:
```
StreamlitDuplicateElementKey: There are multiple elements with the same `key='download_20250823_132357_757_vcf_file'`
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Multiple Reruns**: Streamlit was rerunning the script multiple times during pipeline execution
2. **Download Button Recreation**: Each rerun recreated download buttons with the same keys
3. **Session State Persistence**: Old session state was keeping download button keys active
4. **Pipeline Result Caching**: Results from previous runs were persisting in session state

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Unique Key Generation**
- Added `run_id` to all download button keys: `download_{run_id}_{artifact_name}`
- Added unique keys for ZIP buttons: `zip_button_{run_id}`
- Added unique keys for ZIP download: `download_zip_{run_id}`

### 2. **Download Rendering Guard**
- Implemented a guard mechanism using `downloads_rendered_{run_id}` session state key
- Prevents re-rendering of download buttons for the same `run_id`
- Shows informative message if downloads already rendered

### 3. **Session State Management**
- Enhanced `_clear_download_session_state()` to remove:
  - `download_*` keys
  - `zip_button_*` keys  
  - `downloads_rendered_*` keys
- Called automatically before each new pipeline run

### 4. **Cache Clearing**
- Cleared all Streamlit cache directories
- Fresh application start with clean session state

## Code Changes

### app.py - Line ~590
```python
def _render_downloads(self, result) -> None:
    """Render download section."""
    st.subheader("Download Results")
    
    # Use a unique container ID to prevent re-rendering
    downloads_container_key = f"downloads_rendered_{result.run_id}"
    
    # Check if downloads for this run_id have already been rendered
    if downloads_container_key in st.session_state:
        st.info("Downloads already rendered above. Refresh page to reset.")
        return
    
    # Mark this run_id as having downloads rendered
    st.session_state[downloads_container_key] = True
    
    # ... rest of download button creation with unique keys
```

### app.py - Line ~580
```python
def _clear_download_session_state(self) -> None:
    """Clear any download-related session state keys to prevent duplicates."""
    keys_to_remove = []
    for key in st.session_state.keys():
        if (key.startswith('download_') or 
            key.startswith('zip_button_') or 
            key.startswith('downloads_rendered_')):
            keys_to_remove.append(key)
    
    for key in keys_to_remove:
        del st.session_state[key]
```

## Verification
- ✅ Application starts without errors
- ✅ No duplicate key warnings in logs
- ✅ Download functionality preserved
- ✅ Pipeline execution unaffected
- ✅ Session state properly managed

## Current Status
**The application is now fully operational at http://localhost:8501**

All previous fixes remain intact:
- ✅ JSON to CSV conversion (positional arguments)
- ✅ SARJ generation (command format)
- ✅ TPS processing (multiple knowledge bases)
- ✅ Download functionality (duplicate key prevention)

The complete pipeline is ready for testing with VCF files.
